Assignment step - 
1) create a table in mysq & pull using sqoop.
2) create table on top of files that pulled using sqoop.
3) Now, update or add some records in mysql.
4) This time, same table in hive should have updated & added records.
5) For above thing, mysql table is full load.. But i want to maintain history at hive end. 
6)Finally all old, history, new data should be only 1 hive table...! Ex----> emp table.

above, only 1 column i taken... you can add another columns like ename, sal etc......
Also, you can use or create number of intermeduate tables for any operation. But at the end,
resultant table should be only 1.


Think on below once you done with above & then complete below part(script).......!

All above things, write in shell script. i mean once i executed shell script, this all should happen automatically....!
Means, every time when i run script, my final "emp" table will have old, new, updated records.....!
